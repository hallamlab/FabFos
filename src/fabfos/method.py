"""The method version: what FabFos *is*, as opposed to what it is running.

`version.txt` versions the CLI package. This versions the **method** -- the
composition of canon, the transform library, the container digests, the type
contract and the data library that together decide what a number coming out of
this pipeline means. The two move independently: a CLI bugfix is not a new
method, and repinning the engine library is a new method even if no fabfos
source changed.

The shape is metasmith's (`metasmith/constants.py`): a bare version file that
a human bumps, a content hash stamped alongside it, and a full version string
combining the two. The difference is *what* is hashed. Metasmith hashes its
source tree, because metasmith is the source tree. A method is not a tree --
it is a composition -- so what is hashed here is the ordered, canonically
serialized set of things that would change an answer:

  1. canon's content, and its declared STATUS
  2. the transform library's commit, and whether it was dirty
  3. metasmith's own FULL_VERSION (already version+build_hash)
  4. every container name -> digest, sorted
  5. the sha256 of the data library's index (the index, not 46 GB of bytes --
     the index already carries a per-item sha256, so hashing it transitively
     covers the data)
  6. the type contract -- one library per namespace, since a type's property
     set is what the planner matches on
  7. the planner's domain list, because the candidate space is part of the
     method

Deliberately NOT hashed: user inputs, output paths, thread counts, runtime
choice, wall-clock. Those belong to a *run*. A run is described by the manifest
this module also writes; a method is described by the id.

Hashing canon by content means editing one of its comments bumps the method
id. That is accepted on purpose: canon's prose is not decoration, it is where
the method's decisions are written down, and a reader who changes what it says
has changed what the pipeline claims. Better a spurious bump than a silent one.

Stamping REFUSES while any container record is unresolved. A method id that
covers an image nobody else can pull is a promise the method cannot keep.
